Sorry for the delays!! We are busy with other affairs for the moment so we cannot make OrangeShell just yet... DONT WORRY! We are STILL making OrangeShell, we have not given it up.

PLEASE READ:
We are going to port OrangeShell ENTIRELY to Linux. If you want to run this in Windows, please enable the Windows Subsystem For Linux, install your favourite distro (I would choose Debian) and install python3 and pip3
After installing python3 and pip3 just use the bash shell to run "./launch.sh" and the shell should start.

OrangeShell Status: RELEASED V1.5.0
OrangeShell 2.0.0 is in production! Due release: JAN 2021
=============================

DOWNLOAD OrangeShell 1.5.0 FROM HERE AND NOT USING THE COMMAND "update" --> UpdateManager had a small syntax error which caused the update to fail. This should fix it.

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE OrangeShell 1.5.0 OR HIGHER, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD A NEW VERSION FROM HERE! A
BUILT IN COMMAND CALLED "update" WILL UPDATE OrangeShell FOR YOU !

OrangeShell README

Hello and thanks for your interest in Orange Shell! I will give you a full walkthrough of my Python program in
this README file...

What is Orange Shell?

OrangeShell is a small python program which provides a commandline
interface.

Still with us? Good.

SETUP

Setup is partly user dependent. You have to extract the files into any directory (v1.0.0+ has a dynamic root directory)
and have Python3 installed.

If you have a pre 2.0.0 release of OrangeShell (then called OrangeOS) then you must have these python modules installed:
colorama, hashlib, getpass, requests, importlib, zipfile

OrangeShell 2.0.0+ auto installs all needed modules for you,
OrangeOS 1.5.0+ has a user setup which takes the pressure of setting up OrangeShell partially off you.

How you can get these python packages (after installing Python3 and pip3):
COLORAMA = pip3 install colorama
HASHLIB = pip3 install hashlib
GETPASS = pip3 install getpass
REQUESTS = pip3 install requests
IMPORTLIB = pip3 install importlib
ZIPFILE = pip3 install zipfile

GET PYTHON HERE: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.8/python-3.7.8-amd64.exe

Once you do that just run launch.sh and log in to the default user account. Login details:

CREDENTIALS FOR ORANGESHELL 0.5.0 TO 1.5.0:
Username = default
Password = orangeos

CREDENTIALS FOR ORANGESHELL 2.0.0+:
USERNAME = default
PASSWORD = orangeshell

You are advised to change your password or make a new account entirely.
To assure you, passwords are stored HASHED on your computer in ROOT\System\UMS (after you
extract) so nothing ever leaves your computer.
